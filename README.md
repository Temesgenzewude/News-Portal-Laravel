In this project, I have built a news portal application using Laravel PHP and MySQL :

The front/client side of the application  have the latest breaking news section, the news display section, the latest news section as well as other sections. The footer has the listing of the latest posts, as well as the categories display with the number of posts, count per category. The normal user won't be able to access the admin panel. The writer will be able to access the admin panel but will not be able to access some features like seeing or editing other people's posts. The admin will have full CRUD rights on all the sections of the admin panel.
